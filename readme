Amanda: For regserver.py, I wrote the Client Handler Thread, the handle 
client function, the check request function, and the main function logic. I 
also figured out the modularity in regserver.py. I also moved the logic 
from Assignment 1 to our get overview function and get details function. 
I also added more tests to testregdetails.py and testregoverviews.py. For 
regoverviews.py and regdetails.py, I wrote the socket logic for main and
the logic in the receive response function.

Arnold: For regserver.py, I wrote the read request function and write 
response function. I also figured out the JSON formatting in the get 
overview function and get detail function. I also wrote the consume cpu 
time function. For regoverviews.py and regdetails.py, I wrote the valid
request function and the send request function. I also modularized the code
in both files so they were organized into functions. I also fixed all of 
the formatting errors using pylint.

Learnings:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The assignment helped us gain a better understanding of how servers 
and threading worked, including receiving responses, validating responses, 
and sending responses, all of which were new concepts to us. We also gained 
a better understanding of how to format data into JSON. We also learned
how to improve our modularity and organization by separating code into 
functions.

With respect to I/O and compute delays, in a high-volume environment under 
what circumstances is regserver.py better than regserverprelim.py?

Regserver.py is better than regserverprelim.py in circumstances where
concurrency improves performance and efficiency. These circumstances 
include CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized, I/O-bound applications 
that involve concurrency over sequential processing, and server a
applications.

With respect to I/O and compute delays, in a high-volume environment under 
what circumstances is regserver.py not better than regserverprelim.py?

Regserverprelim.py is not better than regserverprelim.py in circumstances
where the task is sequential like reading a file line by line or when the
overhead of thread management outweighs performance benefits.
